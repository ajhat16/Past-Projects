Website Link (connected through github pages): https://pages.github.umn.edu/SummerProject2022/JavaLearningWebsite/ 

The files in this folder are the files fully written by me.

I developed the blue navigation bar at the top of the website page (once you login),
the three line menu button with the dropdown menu it opens, the template for the 
lessons that all group members used, and the arithmetic, floating point, and
variables lessons.
